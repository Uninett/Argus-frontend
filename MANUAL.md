## What is Argus?
Argus is an _alert aggregator_ designed for storing and managing alerts from different monitoring systems at one place.
Argus is created for **ease of alarm management** and **customizable alarm notifications**.

## Log into Argus
Argus supports several login mechanisms:
* _username-password login_
* _federated login with OAuth 2.0_

Log in and start using Argus at **/login**.
<img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 17.08.07.png"/>

### Login using username and password
1. Fill out _username_ and _password_.

   <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 17.08.37.png"/>

2. Press `LOGIN`.

   <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 17.08.37 copy.png"/>

### Login using OAuth 2.0 (Feide in the example below)
1. Press `LOGIN WITH OAUTH2`.

   <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 17.08.37 copy 2.png"/>

2. Select account you want to log in with.

   <img height="461" src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-07 at 13.56.03.png" width="354"/>

   <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-07 at 13.55.48.png" width="354" height="740"/>

4. Continue with the preferred method for two-factor authentication.

### Debugging Network errors on Login

If you get a following error message at the top of the _Login_ page:

  <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 17.19.38.png"/>

1. Open _developer console_ in your browser.  
2. Check the error message in the console. 
   * _Connection refused_ error message indicates that the Argus API server is unavailable. 
   * _CORS_ error message indicates misconfiguration of the Argus settings.

Please visit [Argus documentation](https://argus-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) if you need help with the configuration.

Note that we intend to direct you to the browser's developer console for a specific error message in the case of network errors. 
This is due to the fact that some network requests are meant to be delegated to browsers, not the web applications (f.e. [preflight requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request)). 


## Work with alarms in Argus
**View**, **filter** and **update** alarms that come to Argus from different sources (monitoring systems).

<img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-08 at 14.18.46.png"/>

You can see all of your monitoring systems that are connected to Argus in the _Sources selector_. Click on the _Sources selector_ and all available monitoring systems will appear in the drop-down menu.

<img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-22 at 09.18.46.png"/>

### What is an incident in Argus
An incident is an alarm that was sent to Argus from a monitoring system of your choice.

Each incident has a _description_ (created by the monitoring system), _start time_, _duration_, _source_ (which monitoring system it came from), _tags_ and _severity level_. An incident may have _end time_, _ticket url_ (associated ticket in an external ticket system).
Incidents may have different status. For example, an incident may be _open_, or _closed_ (resolved). An incident may also be _acknowledged_ (noticed or commented in any way), or not. 
In the detailed incident view below you can get familiar with the above-mentioned attributes of an incident. Note that an incident's event feed is also available in the detailed view. The event feed shows events like _closing_ (resolving), and _acknowledgment_ of an incident.

<img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-08 at 14.28.18.png"/>

Each row in the _Incidents_ table is one alarm. In the table you can see an incident's _start time_, _closed/open status_, whether an incident has at least one _acknowledgement_, _severity level_, _source_ (which monitoring system the incident came from), _description_ (created by the monitoring system) and whether the incident has an associated _ticket url_ (label icon at the very end of the row).

<img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-09 at 08.21.36.png"/>

### Decide which incidents are shown in the table
For ease of alarm management you can filter incidents so that only incidents that match all preferred parameters are shown in the _Incidents_ table.

Apply the preferred filter by using the _Filter toolbar_. Argus will remember your filter settings from the last login session, and will use those until you change them.

_Filter toolbar_ is available:
* Below the header in full-screen view.

  <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-09 at 10.30.37.png"/>
  
* In the _Filter Options dropdown_ in mobile view.

#### Filter by open/close status
* If you only want _open_ incidents to be displayed in the table, press `OPEN` in the _Open State selector_.

  <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-09 at 13.58.35.png"/>

* If you only want _closed_ (resolved) incidents to be displayed in the table, press `CLOSED` in the _Open State selector_.

  <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-09 at 13.58.35 copy.png"/>

* If you want both _open_ and _closed_ (resolved) incidents to be displayed in the table, press `BOTH` in the _Open State selector_.

  <img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-09-09 at 13.58.35 copy 2.png"/>

#### Filter by acknowledgement status
* If you only want _acknowledged_ incidents to be displayed in the table, press `ACKED` in the _Acked selector_.

* If you want the table to display incidents from **any monitoring system**, leave the _Sources field_ empty.


#### Filter by tags
* If you want the table to display only incidents that have a **specific tag(s)**:
  1. Type in a _tag_ into the _Tags input field_ in the format `tag_name=tag_value`.

### What is a timeslot in Argus
A timeslot is a collection of one or more recurrences with a meaningful name. Saved timeslots can be used when [customizing alarm notifications](#customize-alarm-notifications-in-argus). Each timeslot represents a window (or several windows) of time for when it is OK to receive alarm notifications.

Note that every user has the default timeslot _All the time_:

<img src="public/screenshots/manual/Screenshot 2022-10-06 at 15.01.51.png"/>


### What is a recurrence in Argus
Recurrences are building blocks for timeslots. Each recurrence represents a time range on selected weekdays for when it is OK to receive alarm notifications.
A time range can either be:
* a whole day, 
* or a window of time

Each recurrence has only one time range, and it applies to all days that are selected in a given recurrence. 

For example, in this timeslot with 3 recurrences, alarm notifications are allowed from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m. on business days (note that it is not possible to have a recurrence that goes from one day to the next), and all hours on weekends:
